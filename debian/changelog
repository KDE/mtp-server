  * Remove the limit on respawns on mtp-server to workaround the fact that on
    unplug/plug, the USB device gets quickly reset a few times and that makes
    mtp fail reads and exit, which triggers a restart of the job. (LP: #1392405)

  [ Stéphane Graber ]
  * Fix upstart jobs. The system job was marked as task but wasn't a
    task and was therefore keeping lxc-android-config in post-start. The
    user job was working fine, but was backgrounding the process on the exec
    line instead of just letting upstart track it directly.

    a mtp device but no server attached to it (LP: #1226825).
